Crypto-Key-Strength-Checker
===========================

A small Java application created for my Cryptography course which checks the strength of a password key

Description
------------

A java application which takes in a set of keys, formed by a product of two prime numbers, and outputs whether they are a strong or bad key.
The application finds the factors of the keys, and compares them to a give minimum size to check if it is strong or bad.
